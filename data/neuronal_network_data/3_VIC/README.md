## ANN data for VIC-type model setup

The gridded forcing data are only shared via a **separate download link**
since they are too large to be stored on GitHub and the data are under
licence.

The shapefiles are used to aggregate the gridded forcing data onto the
sub-watershed discretization level. The outlet of each of the 46
sub-watersheds in this setup corresponds to a streamflow station of
interest.
