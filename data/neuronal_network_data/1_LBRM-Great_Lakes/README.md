## ML data for lumped LBRM-type model setup

Hi Julie,

As a quick update, I've processed the meteorology data and LBRM output in txt files for the time period of January 1st, 1950 through April 10th, 2019. Of note, we have data from 1940 forward, However, I have been advised the first ten years were a spin-up period for the model. Therefore, I've only included meteorology and LBRM output from 1950 forward. Additionally, the LBRM output for 2018 & 2019 should be treated as preliminary. However, I've included it as the more data you have closer to present day might be useful to relate to (close to) present day geophysical characteristics of the sub-basins. 

I've left the meteorology in a very similar format to that used by Ostrich in case you have the ability and would like to run LBRM through the calibration procedure at any point in time. The LBRM output is in a similar format. They should both be fairly easy to input in excel (if needed). I've also included the final csv output matching the gage ids to the appropriate sub-basins. The method of 'matching' refers to those gages which have been confirmed to be in the sub-basin it is matched to based off the fact that Tim Hunter sent a list containing these gages and their associated sub-basin. The rest of the gages were assigned to any appropriate sub-basin using ArcGIS and the new maps. 

The file is too big to be attached via e-mail but I have sent it using a Department of Defense file transfer service previously called ARMDEC. You should receive a notification shortly to pick up the zipped file containing the meteorology, LBRM output, and matching csv. There were 7 calibration gages in objective 1 and/or 2 which were outside of the Great Lakes basin and therefore do not have associated meteorology or LBRM output, bringing the total number of calibration gages in either one or both of objectives within the Great Lakes basin to 134 rather than 141. The 7 gages which are not associated with a sub-basin the Great Lakes are identified in the csv file.

If you have any questions or comments (or need anything else in the different format) feel free to let me know.

Respectfully, Emily Bradley

Hi Julie,

Due to working through some issues in the calibration procedure, I've recently discovered that the previous files sent to you with the storages and forcings were scaled using the area ratio method when this was, in fact, not necessary. This is due to the fact that the units are expressed in mm over the respective area. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I wanted to send you the unscaled (corrected) storages and meteorology. Again, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have cause and if I can provide any further information, feel free to let me know. I will be sending the corrected data (with unscaled storages and precipitation) to you via ARMDEC momentarily if it is of any use to you moving forward.

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,
Emily Bradley
