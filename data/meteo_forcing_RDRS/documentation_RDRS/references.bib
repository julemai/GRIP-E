  abstract = {A parameterization of land surface processes to be included in mesoscale and large-scale meteorological models is presented. The number of parameters has been reduced as much as possible, while attempting to preserve the representation of the physics which controls the energy and water budgets. We distinguish two main classes of parameters. The spatial distribution of primary parameters, i.e., the dominant types of soil and vegetation within each grid cell, can be specified from existing global datasets. The secondary parameters, describing the physical properties of each type of soil and vegetation, can be inferred from measurements or derived from numerical experiments. A single surface temperature is used to represent the surface energy balance of the land/cover system. The soil heat flux is linearly interpolated between its value over bare ground and a value of zero for complete shielding by the vegetation. The ground surface moisture equation includes the effect of gravity and the thermo-hydric coefficients of the equations have been either calculated or calibrated using textural dependent formulations. The calibration has been made using the results of a detailed soil model forced by prescribed atmospheric mean conditions. The results show that the coefficients of the surface soil moisture equation are greatly dependent upon the textural class of the soil, as well as upon its moisture content. The new scheme has been included in a one-dimensional model which allows a complete interaction between the surface and the atmosphere. Several simulations have been performed using data collected during HAPEX-MOBILHY. These first results show the ability of the parameterization to reproduce the components of the surface energy balance over a wide variety of surface conditions.},

To improve mesoscale forecasts of wind, temperature, and dewpoint temperature in this layer, two different approaches are examined. In the first experiment, the vertical resolution of a limited-area model with 2.5-km grid spacing (LAM-2.5 km) is significantly increased near the surface to better represent profiles in that layer. In the second experiment, prognostic variables for land and ocean surfaces are initialized using results from an external land surface model system [the Global Environmental Multiscale Surface system (GEM-Surf)] and from a regional ocean model. Results show that increasing the vertical resolution near the surface leads to improved temperature and dewpoint temperature forecasts at the surface and in the wind turbine layer. For winds, improvements are more modest, because they are limited to the gradient measured across the span of the vertical wind turbine blades. On the other hand, the replacement of operational surface analyses with high-resolution analyses obtained from GEM-Surf is found to improve summer dewpoint temperature forecasts. It is shown that changes in soil moisture analyses explain the bulk of the improved dewpoint forecasts.},

As part of this study, the Canadian version of the Interactions between Soil\textendash{}Biosphere\textendash{}Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface scheme has been coupled to Environment Canada's numerical weather prediction model within the REPS. For 20 summer periods in 2009, stochastic perturbations of surface parameters have been generated in several experiments. Each experiment corresponds to 20 simulations differing by the perturbations at the initial time of one or several surface parameters or prognostic variables. The sensitivity to these perturbations is quantified especially for 2-m temperature, 10-m wind speed, cloud fraction, and precipitation up to 48-h lead time. Spatial variability of these sensitivities over the North American continent shows that soil moisture, albedo, leaf area index, and SST have the largest impacts on the screen-level variables. The temporal evolution of these sensitivities appears to be closely linked to the diurnal cycle of the boundary layer. The surface perturbations are shown to increase the ensemble spread of the REPS for all screen-level variables especially for 2-m temperature and 10-m wind speed during daytime. A preliminary study of the impact on the ensemble forecast has shown that the inclusion of the surface perturbations tends to significantly increase the 2-m temperature and 10-m wind speed skill.},

  abstract = {The Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) has been developed at the Meteorological Research Division of Environment Canada (EC) to better represent the land surface initial states in environmental prediction and assimilation systems. CaLDAS is built around an external land surface modeling system and uses the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) methodology. A unique feature of CaLDAS is the use of improved precipitation forcing through the assimilation of precipitation observations. An ensemble of precipitation analyses is generated by combining numerical weather prediction (NWP) model precipitation forecasts with precipitation observations. Spatial phasing errors to the NWP first-guess precipitation forecasts are more effective than perturbations to the precipitation observations in decreasing (increasing) the exceedance ratio (uncertainty ratio) scores and generating flatter, more reliable ranked histograms. CaLDAS has been configured to assimilate L-band microwave brightness temperature TB by coupling the land surface model with a microwave radiative transfer model. A continental-scale synthetic experiment assimilating passive L-band TBs for an entire warm season is performed over North America. Ensemble metric scores are used to quantify the impact of different atmospheric forcing uncertainties on soil moisture and TB ensemble spread. The use of an ensemble of precipitation analyses, generated by assimilating precipitation observations, as forcing combined with the assimilation of L-band TBs gave rise to the largest improvements in superficial soil moisture scores and to a more rapid reduction of the root-zone soil moisture errors. Innovation diagnostics show that the EnKF is able to maintain a sufficient forecast error spread through time, while soil moisture estimation error improvements with increasing ensemble size were limited.},

  abstract = {Summary
The Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) is a data analysis system used operationally at the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC) since April 2011 to produce gridded 6-h and 24-h precipitation accumulations in near real-time on a regular grid covering all of North America. The current resolution of the product is 10-km. Due to the low density of the observational network in most of Canada, the system relies on a background field provided by the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) of Environment Canada, which is a short-term weather forecasting system for North America. For this reason, the North American configuration of CaPA is known as the Regional Deterministic Precipitation Analysis (RDPA). Early in the development of the CaPA system, weather radar reflectivity was identified as a very promising additional data source for the precipitation analysis, but necessary quality control procedures and bias-correction algorithms were lacking for the radar data. After three years of development and testing, a new version of CaPA\textendash{}RDPA system was implemented in November 2014 at CMC. This version is able to assimilate radar quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs) from all 31 operational Canadian weather radars. The radar QPE is used as an observation source and not as a background field, and is subject to a strict quality control procedure, like any other observation source. The November 2014 upgrade to CaPA\textendash{}RDPA was implemented at the same time as an upgrade to the RDPS system, which brought minor changes to the skill and bias of CaPA\textendash{}RDPA. This paper uses the frequency bias indicator (FBI), the equitable threat score (ETS) and the departure from the partial mean (DPM) in order to assess the improvements to CaPA\textendash{}RDPA brought by the assimilation of radar QPE. Verification focuses on the 6-h accumulations, and is done against a network of 65 synoptic stations (approximately two stations per radar) that were withheld from the station data assimilated by CaPA\textendash{}RDPA. It is shown that the ETS and the DPM scores are both improved for precipitation events between 0.2mm and 25mm per 6-h, and that the FBI is unchanged.},

  abstract = {Recently, the computing facilities available to the Meteorological Service of Canada were significantly upgraded. This provided an opportunity to improve the resolution of the global ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the medium-range Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS). In the EnKF, the main upgrades include improved horizontal, vertical, and temporal resolution. With the introduction of the higher horizontal resolution, it was decided to use a filtered topography in order to address an occasional instability problem. At the same time, the number of assimilated radiance observations was increased via a relaxation of the data-thinning procedures. In the medium-range GEPS, which already used the higher horizontal resolution, the filtered topography was also adopted. Likewise, the temporal resolution was increased to be the same as in the short-range integrations of the EnKF. With these changes, the grid used by the Canadian EnKF has 600 \texttimes{} 300 points in the horizontal and 74 vertical levels. The forecast model uses a 20-min time step and, for time interpolation of the model trajectories, model states are stored every hour. The EnKF uses an ensemble having 192 members. This paper sequentially examines the impact of these implemented changes. The upgraded EnKF became operational at the Canadian Meteorological Centre in mid-February 2013.},

  abstract = {The summertime improvement resulting from the operational implementation of a new surface modeling and assimilation strategy into the Canadian regional weather forecasting system is described in this study. The surface processes over land are represented in this system using the Interactions between Soil\textendash{}Biosphere\textendash{}Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface scheme. Surface variables, including soil moisture, are initialized using a sequential assimilation technique in which model errors of low-level air temperature and relative humidity are used to determine analysis increments of surface variables. It was found that the magnitude and nature of the analysis increments applied to the surface variables depended on the surface and meteorological conditions observed in each region. In regions characterized by weak meteorological activity (i.e., no clouds or precipitation), model errors of low-level air characteristics are more likely to be related to an incorrect representation of surface processes due to either erroneous initial conditions or inaccurate parameterizations in the land surface scheme. In other regions characterized by more frequent and more intense precipitation events, surface corrections are mainly associated with inaccurate atmospheric forcing. Objective evaluation against observations from radiosondes and surface stations showed that the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of near-surface air temperature and humidity is larger with the new surface system, in better agreement with observations. This type of improvement was found to extend higher up in the boundary layer (up to 700 hPa) where cold and humid biases were significantly reduced by introducing the new surface system. The model precipitation was also found to be significantly influenced by the new representation of surface fluxes. The problematic increase of a positive bias in precipitation with integration time was found to be significantly reduced with the new system, due to the warmer and drier boundary layer.},

A number of modifications to ISBA's snow model (i.e., new liquid water reservoir in the snowpack, new formulation of snow density, and melting effect of incident rainfall on the snowpack) were found to improve the numerical representation of snow characteristics. Objective scores for the fully interactive preimplementation tests carried out with the Canadian regional weather forecast model indicated that ISBA's improved snow scheme only had a minor impact on the model's ability to predict atmospheric circulation. The objective scores revealed that only a thin atmospheric layer above snow-covered surfaces was influenced by the change of land surface scheme, and that over these regions the essential behavior of the atmospheric model was not significantly altered by improvements to the treatment of snow cover. It was shown that this lack of response was most likely related to the treatment of the snow cover fraction in each atmospheric model grid tile. The estimation of snow cover fraction relied on simple formulations that were dependent on poorly known parameters, such as the fractional coverage of vegetation. Results showed that uncertainties of only 15\% in vegetation fractional coverage could be responsible for uncertainties of as much as 1\textendash{}1.5 K in screen-level air temperature. This indicates that some care must be exercised in the specification of vegetation and snow cover fractional coverage.},

  abstract = {The Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model is the Canadian atmospheric model used for meteorological forecasting at all scales. A limited-area version now also exists. It is a gridpoint model with an implicit semi-Lagrangian iterative space\textendash{}time integration scheme. In the ``horizontal,'' the equations are written in spherical coordinates with the traditional shallow atmosphere approximations and are discretized on an Arakawa C grid. In the ``vertical,'' the equations were originally defined using a hydrostatic-pressure coordinate and discretized on a regular (unstaggered) grid, a configuration found to be particularly susceptible to noise. Among the possible alternatives, the Charney\textendash{}Phillips grid, with its unique characteristics, and, as the vertical coordinate, log-hydrostatic pressure are adopted. In this paper, an attempt is made to justify these two choices on theoretical grounds. The resulting equations and their vertical discretization are described and the solution method of what is forming the new dynamical core of GEM is presented, focusing on these two aspects.},

  abstract = {An updated global ensemble prediction system became operational at the Meteorological Service of Canada in July 2007. The new elements of the system include the use of 20 members instead of 16, a single dynamical core [the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model], stochastic physical tendency perturbations and a kinetic energy backscatter algorithm, an ensemble Kalman filter with four-dimensional data handling, and a decrease from 1.2$^\circ$ to 0.9$^\circ$ in horizontal grid spacing. This system is compared with the former operational one using a variety of probabilistic measures. For global upper-air dynamical fields, the improvement in predictive skill for equivalent forecast quality is from 9 to 16 h around day 6. Precipitation forecasts, verified over Canada, are also significantly improved. The impact of each of the abovementioned new elements of the ensemble prediction system is also evaluated separately in a series of sensitivity experiments for which one given element is removed from the system.},

  abstract = {Dynamical monthly prediction at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) was produced as part of the seasonal forecasting system over the past two decades. A new monthly forecasting system, which has been in operation since July 2015, is set up based on the operational Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS). This monthly forecasting system is composed of two components: 1) the real-time forecast, where the GEPS is extended to 32 days every Thursday; and 2) a 4-member hindcast over the past 20 years, which is used to obtain the model climatology to calibrate the monthly forecast. Compared to the seasonal prediction system, the GEPS-based monthly forecasting system takes advantage of the increased model resolution and improved initialization.Forecasts of the past 2-yr period (2014 and 2015) are verified. Analysis is performed separately for the winter half-year (November\textendash{}April), and the summer half-year (May\textendash{}October). Weekly averages of 2-m air temperature (T2m) and 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) are assessed. For Z500 in the Northern Hemisphere, limited skill can be found beyond week 2 (days 12\textendash{}18) in summer, while in winter some skill exists over the Pacific and North American region beyond week 2. For T2m in North America, significant skill is found over a large part of the continent all the way to week 4 (days 26\textendash{}32). The distribution of the wintertime T2m skill in North America is consistent with the influence of the Madden\textendash{}Julian oscillation, indicating that a significant part of predictability likely comes from the tropics.},

    abstract = { The Standard Hydrologic Exchange Format (SHEF) has been developed jointly by the National Weather Service (NWS) and by the Corps of Engineers North Pacific Division for use in the interagency Columbia River Operational Hydromet Management System (CROHMS). SHEF features include: (1) Readability by both man and machine; (2) two characters to describe most hydrometeorological parameters; (3) internal data base identification of observational data, processed products, and forecasts; (4) time identification in either local or Greenwich meridian time systems; (5) identification of data from nonstandard locations; (6) optional special data descriptors to individual data values; (7) three different format structures to allow coding on‐station‐per‐line, several lines with common data elements indicated by a header line, and lines of evenly time spaced data strings; (8) flexibility in use of spaces and comments within code text to enhance readability; and (9) ease of use in either English or SI units. The SHEF code holds great potential for easing automated exchanges of operational hydrometeorological data among a wide variety of agencies and reducing the multiplicity of data‐receiving software typical of many broad‐scale operations. }
