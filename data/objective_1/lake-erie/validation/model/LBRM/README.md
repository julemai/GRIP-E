## Validation procedure

1. Mandatory gauges
- using Area-Ratio method to determine the streamflow of gauges
- will be applied to stations: 04185000, 04195500, 04208000

2. Optional gauges
- using Area-Ratio method to determine the streamflow of gauges
- will be applied to stations: 04201500, 02GE003, 04167000, 04168000


Disclaimer: Area-Ratios might include some of the validation stations; hence validation results of LBRM will not be considered and are only added for completeness
