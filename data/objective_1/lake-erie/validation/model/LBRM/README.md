## Validation procedure

1. Mandatory gauges
- using Area-Ratio method to determine the streamflow of gauges
- will be applied to stations: 04185000, 04195500, 04208000

2. Optional gauges
- using Area-Ratio method to determine the streamflow of gauges
- will be applied to stations: 04201500, 02GE003, 04167000, 04168000


<b>Disclaimer:</b><br>
Because the primary application of LBRM is simulating total runoff contribution to
the Great Lakes, calibration conventionally uses area-ratio estimates of runoff for each subbasin
as observations, rather than using streamflow gauge data directly. This approach is used here. In
reality, some of the project validation gauges may have been incorporated to the area-ratio estimates
used for calibration. As a result, information from those validation gauges may be contained within
the calibration dataset. The results for LBRM at the _<b>validation stations are hence not considered</b>_ in
the results and discussion (although they are shown for completeness).
