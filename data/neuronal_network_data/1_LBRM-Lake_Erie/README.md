## ANN data for lumped LBRM-type model setup

The meteorological forcing data are lumped (aggregated) onto the 28 
subwatersheds the U.S. Army Copr of Engineers (USACE) is using to discretize
the Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair watersheds. In a post-processing
these results are then mapped onto the 46 locations where we- in
GRIP-E- compare all the models at. The information on how to map them
is *missing* at the moment. Julie is working on getting this
information from the USACE.

The observed discharge is given at exactly those 28 locations as
well. If we figure out the mapping onto the 46 stations of the GRIP-E
project we will use the 46 time series (right now available already in
the `2_GR4J-Raven-lp` folder).
