Streamflow gauge data for Great Lakes domain following objective 2
(most downstream gauges) used for validation

* folder `csv`: contains streamflow data used for validation for
  objective 2 in CSV/TXT format; be aware that the USGS data are in
  cubic feet per second and WSC data are in cubic meter per second
* folder `netcdf`: contains streamflow data used for validation for
  objective 2 in CF-1.6 compliant NetCDF-4 format; units have been all
  converted into cubic meter per second; quality flags are available
  as well
* folder `model` will contain simulation results of all
  participating models in objective 2 
* file `all_gauges.pdf` shows hydrographs of all streamflow gauge
  stations of objective 2
