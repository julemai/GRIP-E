Temperate or sub-polar needleleaf forest		; 1;  "Forests generally taller than 3 meters and more than 20% of total vegetation cover. This type occurs across the northern United States, Canada and mountainous zones of Mexico. The tree crown cover contains at least 75 percent of needleleaved species"; NALCMS_2
Sub-polar taiga needleleaf forest			; 2;  Forest and woodlands with trees generally taller than 3 meters and more than 5% of total vegetation cover with shrubs and lichens commonly present in the understory. The tree crown cover contains at least 75 percent of needleleaved species. This type occurs across Alaska and northern Canada and may consist of treed muskeg or wetlands. Forest canopies are variable and often sparse, with generally greater tree cover in the southern latitude parts of the zone than the north.; NALCMS_3
Tropical or sub-tropical broadleaf evergreen forest	; 3;  Forests generally taller than 5 meters and more than 20% of total vegetation cover. These occur in the southern United States and Mexico. These forests have greater than 75 percent of tree crown cover represented by evergreen species. ; NALCMS_4
Tropical or sub-tropical broadleaf deciduous forest	; 4;  Forests generally taller than 5 meters and more than 20% of total vegetation cover.  These occur in the southern United States and Mexico. These forests have greater than 75 percent of tree crown cover represented by deciduous species.  ; NALCMS_5
Temperate or sub-polar broadleaf deciduous forest	; 5;  Forests generally taller than 3 meters and more than 20% of total vegetation cover.  These occur in the northern United States, Canada and mountainous zones of Mexico. These forests have greater than 75 percent of tree crown cover represented by deciduous species. ; NALCMS_6
Mixed forest						; 6;  Forests generally taller than 3 meters and more than 20% of total vegetation cover.  Neither needleleaf nor broadleaf tree species occupy more than 75 percent of total tree cover, but are co-dominant.; NALCMS_7
Tropical or sub-tropical shrubland			; 7;  Areas dominated by woody perennial plants with persistent woody stems less than 5 meters tall and typically greater than 20% of total vegetation. This class occurs across the southern United States and Mexico. ; NALCMS_8
Temperate or sub-polar shrubland			; 8;  Areas dominated by woody perennial plants with persistent woody stems less than 3 meters tall and typically greater than 20% of total vegetation.  This class occurs across the northern United States, Canada and highlands of Mexico. ; NALCMS_9
Tropical or sub-tropical grassland			; 9;  Areas dominated by graminoid or herbaceous vegetation generally accounting for greater than 80% of total vegetation cover.  These areas are not subject to intensive management such as tilling, but can be utilized for grazing.  This class occurs across the southern United States and Mexico. ; NALCMS_10
Temperate or sub-polar grassland			; 10; Areas dominated by graminoid or herbaceous vegetation, generally accounting for greater than 80% of total vegetation cover.  These areas are not subject to intensive management such as tilling, but can be utilized for grazing.  This class occurs across Canada, United States and highlands of Mexico.; NALCMS_11
Sub-polar or polar shrubland-lichen-moss		; 11; Areas dominated by dwarf shrubs with lichen and moss typically accounting for at least 20% of total vegetation cover. This class occurs across northern Canada and Alaska.; NALCMS_12
Sub-polar or polar grassland-lichen-moss		; 12; Areas dominated by grassland with lichen and moss typically accounting for at least 20% of total vegetation cover. This class occurs across northern Canada and Alaska. ; NALCMS_13
Sub-polar or polar barren-lichen-moss			; 13; Areas dominated by a mixture of bare areas with lichen and moss that typically account for at least 20% of total vegetation cover. This class occurs across northern Canada and Alaska.; NALCMS_14
Wetland							; 14; Areas dominated by perennial herbaceous and woody wetland vegetation which is influenced by the water table at or near surface over extensive periods of time.  This includes marshes, swamps, bogs, mangroves etc either coastal or inland where water is present for a substantial period annually.; NALCMS_15
Cropland						; 15; Areas dominated by intensively managed crops. These areas typically require human activities for their maintenance. This includes areas used for the production of annual crops, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, maize, vegetables, tobacco, cotton etc and also perennial grasses for grazing and woody crops such as orchards and vineyards. Crop vegetation accounts for greater than 20 percent of total vegetation.  This class does not represent natural grasslands used for light to moderate grazing.; NALCMS_16
Barren lands						; 16; Areas characterized by bare rock, gravel, sand, silt, clay, or other earthen material, with little or no "green" vegetation present regardless of its inherent ability to support life. Generally, vegetation accounts for less than 10% of total cover.; NALCMS_17
Urban							; 17; Areas of open water, generally with less than 25% cover of non-water cover types.  This class refers to areas that are consistently covered by water.; NALCMS_18
Snow and Ice						; 19; Areas characterized by a perennial cover of ice and/or snow, generally greater than 25% of total cover.; NALCMS_19
