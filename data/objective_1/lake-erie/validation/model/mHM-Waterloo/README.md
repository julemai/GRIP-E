## Validation procedure

1. Mandatory gauges
- perform model runs at three mandatory gauging stations with the
parameter sets calibrated to corresponding downstream gauges
- will be applied to stations: 04185000, 04195500, 04208000

2. Optional gauges
- lower priority; might not be submitted
- model set-up will be based on a parameter set using nearest neighbor approach
- will be applied to stations: 04201500, 02GE003, 04167000, 04168000
